COPA1
Lexer+Parser in Projectformat, 
- lexer can produce 3 tokens: 'n'(number), 'o'(operation) and 'c' (character, goes equally for strings)
- interpreter can parse basic math-operations (+,-,*,/) and declaration (e.g. foo=2)
currently get's the input from a string
- main features a live-input by the user via console

TODO: 
- writing a reader for a textfile
- cleaning up, the code is still messy (especially the parser functions)
(- adding functionalitys)
